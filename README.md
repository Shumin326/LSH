# Nearest-Neighbor-for-Amazon-Reivews

This is a course project for ESE 545 data mining at University of Pennsylvania.

- The goal is to find the nearest neighbor (Jaccard distance&lt;0.2) for 150K+ Amazon reviews as efficient as possible.

- k-shingle(a.k.a k-gram), Min-hashing and LSH algorithms are used to dramatically speed up the process.

- The whole process would be done within 10 minutes!!
