# Nearest-Neighbor-for-Amazon-Reivews

This is a course project for ESE 545 data mining at University of Pennsylvania.

- The goal is to find the nearest neighbors (Jaccard distance&lt;0.2) for 150K+ Amazon reviews as efficient as possible. And dump all the similar reviews into a csv file.

- k-shingle(a.k.a k-gram), Min-hashing and LSH algorithms are used to dramatically speed up the process.

- The whole process would be done within 10 minutes!!

- results:
1. similar review is found given text

![](query_found)

2. similar review is not found given text

![](query_no)

3. all the similar reviews in the dataset
